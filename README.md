# Duckweb Autofill
Autofills login info for the University of Oregon's DuckWeb.

Since the site was apparently written in the 1960s, both input boxes are marked as "password" types, so your normal autofill apps don't really work. This is a specialized extension that literally only works on DuckWeb.

## How It Works

1. The user enters their UO ID and PAC and the info is saved to Chrome storage.
2. Whenever they load the DuckWeb page, the input boxes are immediately populated with appropriate login info.
